# Active Context: jarvis-proxy

## Current Work Focus

### Project Initialization Phase
We are currently in the **project setup and documentation** phase. The user is restructuring the project documentation to:
1. Create a comprehensive memory-bank system for project context
2. Rewrite README.md to be concise and English-focused
3. Extract detailed development roadmap to separate documentation

### Recent Changes
- **Documentation Restructure**: Moving from single Vietnamese README to structured English/Vietnamese documentation
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Establishing proper project context documentation
- **README Simplification**: Preparing to create concise English README

### Current Session Goals
1. ✅ Create memory-bank structure with core files:
   - ✅ projectbrief.md - Project overview and requirements
   - ✅ productContext.md - Problem statement and user experience goals  
   - ✅ systemPatterns.md - Architecture and design patterns
   - ✅ techContext.md - Technology stack and setup
   - ⏳ activeContext.md - Current focus (this file)
   - ⏳ progress.md - Implementation status

2. ⏳ Create new concise English README.md
3. ⏳ Create detailed Vietnamese development roadmap file

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Documentation Language Strategy
- **English**: Technical documentation, README, code comments
- **Vietnamese**: Development roadmap, learning materials, detailed guides
- **Rationale**: English for broader accessibility, Vietnamese for detailed local context

### Project Structure Decisions
- **Separate concerns**: Core docs vs learning materials
- **Memory-bank pattern**: Consistent documentation structure for AI assistance
- **Version control**: All documentation in git for change tracking

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete progress.md to capture current implementation status
2. Create concise English README.md focusing on:
   - Quick start guide
   - Core features
   - Basic setup instructions
3. Create detailed Vietnamese roadmap file with:
   - Learning progression levels
   - Detailed technical diagrams
   - Step-by-step implementation guides

## Questions to Address
- Should we include example configurations in the new README?
- How detailed should the English README be vs the Vietnamese roadmap?
- What level of technical detail is appropriate for each audience?

## Dependencies & Blockers
- None currently identified
- User feedback needed on documentation approach and content balance

## Context for Next Session
After this documentation restructure, the next major phase will be implementing the actual infrastructure:
1. Docker Compose configuration
2. Traefik setup with SSL
3. Cloudflared tunnel configuration
4. Dashboard and monitoring setup
5. Example application deployment

The memory-bank will serve as the foundation for all future development work, ensuring consistency and context preservation across sessions.
